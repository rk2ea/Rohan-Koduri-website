              I am Rohan Koduri, a 2019 graduate from the School of Engineering and Applied Science within the University of Virginia with a B.S. in Computer Science and Minor in Business. Ever since, I have been working as a Software Developer. 
              However, I've managed to find time for other things. I've been to 29 countries in my short life, each of which has taught me so much about myself and other cultures.

              Both inside and now outside the classroom, I've had the opportunity to work with so many interesting technologies. In the past year alone, I've learned so much
              through my involvement in the <strong>Patent Pending</strong> <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/90038838" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Secure Data FabricÂ®</a>, volunteering as a developer for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target='_blank' href='https://excesstoneeds.org/'>Excess to Needs</a>, and especially coaching youth soccer.
